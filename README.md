# Outlier Detection Report

## Dataset: Employees Dataset

### Executive Summary

The goal of this analysis was to identify and handle outliers in the Employees dataset during the cleaning process. The dataset contains information about employees, including attributes such as department, age, training history, and performance metrics.

### Outlier Detection Methods

1. **Z-Score:**
   - Calculated the Z-score for numeric columns.
   - Considered values with an absolute Z-score greater than 3 as potential outliers.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Computed descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles, to assess the central tendency and spread of numeric columns.

3. **Box Plot Visualizations:**
   - Utilized box plots to visually inspect the distribution of numeric variables and identify potential outliers.

### Findings

After a comprehensive analysis using Z-score, descriptive statistics, and box plots, no outliers were detected in the Employees dataset.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Z-Score Analysis:**
   - Calculated Z-scores for each numeric variable.
   - Checked for values with an absolute Z-score exceeding the threshold of 3.
   - Found no instances where Z-scores indicated outliers.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Examined mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numeric variables.
   - Confirmed that the statistics fell within expected ranges, indicating the absence of outliers.

3. **Box Plot Visualizations:**
   - Visualized distributions using box plots for key numeric variables.
   - No data points were observed outside the whiskers, reinforcing the absence of outliers.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the thorough exploration of the Employees dataset using Z-score, descriptive statistics, and box plots revealed no outliers. The absence of outliers suggests that the dataset is relatively homogeneous in terms of numeric values, and no extreme or unusual observations were identified.

### Recommendations

Given the absence of outliers, further data cleansing actions may focus on standardizing or scaling numeric variables, ensuring consistency in data formats, and addressing any missing or inconsistent values.

### Next Steps

The dataset is now deemed suitable for subsequent analysis and modeling. The cleaning process has successfully addressed potential outliers, providing a foundation for robust and reliable data-driven insights.
